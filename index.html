Being a part of one the biggest coding competition in Pakistan, the working was spanned around 2 months. It held events from speed programming to App/Web Development and from UI/UX to AI module. More than 100 teams were a part of the this amazing event which took place in an online setting due to the sudden surge of Covid-19 in Lahore once again. This event taught me and my team, the resiliance, project management and team-work.  </p>

                <p>A course offered as a part of Harvard's and Lakshmi Mittal South Asian Institue, CELP. It gave me a hollistic and systematic approach to technology entrepreneurship. From generating new use scenarios by matching customer needs with promising technology seeds, then to align business and operating models. This unique certification by a wonderful faculty at HBS taught us how to evaluate a technology for readiness and market fit where it concluded on how to position opportunities to secure funding for the ventures.</p>

                <p>A six hour long workshop managed by Nvidia Deep Learning Institute, on Accelerated Data Science with RAPIDS which covers the use of clustered GPU's in many of the advanced data science concepts. This unique workshop led by Prof. Abdul Bais at LUMS provided me hands on experience of cuDF, cuML, xgBoost and a lot more. This traning concluded on a capstone project with the application of all the concepts on a "BIODEFENSE" case study. </p>

                <p>Upon completion of this 8-hours long workshop powered by NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, we were able to work on the basic principles and technology needed for effective deep learning. Moreover,  a few datasets were improved by data augmentation, and transfer learning between models was implemented to get effective results with less data and computational resources.</p>
